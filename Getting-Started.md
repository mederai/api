## Get Started

Medera Medical Diagnosis Engine MMDE is designed to leverage our unique and aggregate medical knowledge-base developed by Medera to provide a helpful health insight. The diagnostic reasoning depends on the patient observation including symptoms and risk factors.

We are working hard with our partners to enrich the medical knowledge base with interactive observation features needed such as symptoms, risk factors, medication, and laboratory tests. 


Medera provides solutions to telehealth and healthcare providers including medical diagnosis and queue system engines. Currently, we offer multi-languages medical diagnosis API endpoints in a beta form which can help us and the healthcare community to build a new digital health ecosystem.
Below you'll find our API documentation and a few interactive components that allow you to interact directly with our data endpoints (no code required). Please direct any questions or requests to info@meder.ai
